 Abstract = {Tcl is a highly dynamic language that is especially challenging to execute efficiently. In this paper, I discuss many issues involved in implementing Tcl, and describe a design for a faster system that maintains Tcl semantics, including its C callout mechanism. This design focuses on a method for caching the parsed representation for data values, and lazily converting to strings on demand. This allows most computations to be performed using native types (e.g. integers) rather than strings. The current implementation is presented along with results showing a speedup of about 5-10 times over the existing Tcl interpreter.}

 abstract = {Tcl is an interpreter for a tool command language. It consists of a library package that is embedded in tools (such as editors, debuggers, etc.) as the basic command interpreter. Tcl provides (a) a parser for a simple textual command language, (b) a collection of built-in utility commands, and (c) a C interface that tools use to augment the built-in commands with tool-specific commands. Tcl is particularly attractive when integrated with the widget library of a window system: it increases the programmability of the widgets by providing mechanisms for variables, procedures, expressions, etc.; it allows users to program both the appearance and the actions of widgets; and it offers a simple but powerful communication mechanism between interactive programs.}
